A project where I learned some construction techniques, such as how to use a drill.

So there was actually a sign up/RSVP for the event, hosted by Texas Inventionworks, but it filled up. Luckilly, I
was just there on the day this happened and a few people didn't show up so I got to do it and got the free stuff.

I had to redo the frame a couple of times because I kept on destroying it with the drill. There was also
some soldering done in this.

The infinity mirror works with two acryllic panels. One is a one way mirror, while the other is a two way mirror.
By making these two mirrors the panels of a box, we get an infinity mirror.
