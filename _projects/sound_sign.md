This is a project for UT Makeathon 2022. The theme for this competition was improving work place accessibility.
My team came up with Sound Sign, a wet floor sign which makes noise when it comes into contact with water.

It has an arduino inside and detects water through aluminum foil pads. The sound is made through a buzzer.

There is also an ultrasonic sensor to change the sound if an object gets too close to the sign.
