anjin is my latest game engine, I think it might be my second or third iteration of a game engine.
It's the successor to jin (game enJIN), and this one means AN enJIN. It's also an anagram for ninja.

The goal is to write as much of the engine as possible. There are some cool things in here.

- OpenGL for graphics
- OpenAL for audio
- Windows port
- Emscripten web port
- No linux port (my last engine, jin, did, I just don't have dual boot at the time of writing)
- Archetype ECS
