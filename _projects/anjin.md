anjin is my latest game engine, I think it might be my second or third iteration of a game engine.
It's the successor to jin (game enJIN), and this one means AN enJIN. It's also an anagram for ninja.

The goal is to write as much of the engine as possible. It's just a personal project, sholdn't be
used for actual game development unless you are me. I am trying to get it to a point where I
could make 2D games with it, but it's just for fun. There are some cool things in here:

- OpenGL for graphics
- OpenAL for audio
- Windows port
- Emscripten web port
- Archetype ECS

Here are some web ports of demos I made with it:
